<h2>Essay Writing Tips </h2>
</div>
<div class="heading">
1.<strong> Begin with a anecdote.</strong>
</div>
  - Studies have shown that although students spend weeks perfecting their statements in their <br> college essays,
  admissions officers spend no more than three to five minutes reading them. Given this, it would be best to grab <br> their attention right away.
  What better way to do that than with a short story about<br> something you expierenced that can portray your charecter? Also,
  remember that the <br> admissions officers are more interested in your perspective of what happened than the events themselves.<br>
  <div class="heading">
2. <strong> Start Early So You Re-read Your Essay.</strong>
</div>
  - Go ahead- write your essay. Then put it away for a day or two and come back and <br>
  read it and try to read in the admissions officer's point of view. You'd be surprised at how much a fresh <br>
  outlook on your paper will help you.<br>
  <div class="heading">
3. <strong> Let Other People Read It - But Not Too Many. </strong>
</div>
  - Although you may feel the need to allow anyone who is willing to read your paper, this would not be wise. <br> After too many
  opinions, you will begin to loose <br> you voice in your own paper. Thats not too say that no one
  should look over it, but just be cautious <br>
  about the fact that this is YOUR paper - YOUR voice.
