  <p> This scholaship is based more on the perserverance of a student rather than their academic achievement. With the qualifying grade point average
  held at just 2.0, it is evident that they are more worried about you as a student rather than your grades. Also to qualify for this
scholarship, your household income must be less than 55,000$ a year. This is targeted so that financially disadvantaged students
can still have a chance to succeed. </p>
